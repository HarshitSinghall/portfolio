  // Challenge
  challenge: {
    overview:
      "Users increasingly need simple tools to track their movements, visualize routes, and log travel history without complex fitness or social app clutter. UTrackMe was developed to give users a lightweight, privacy-aware solution for real-time location tracking, route visualization, and history recording — all while preserving battery life and responding smoothly to varying GPS conditions.",
    points: [
      "Achieving accurate GPS tracking in varying environments (urban canyons, indoors)",
      "Balancing location update frequency with battery efficiency",
      "Rendering routes and markers smoothly on Google Maps",
      "Organizing travel logs for easy future reference",
      "Ensuring privacy and security for sensitive location data"
