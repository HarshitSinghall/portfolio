  // Challenge
  challenge: {
    overview:
      "Users increasingly demand secure ways to hide sensitive files, photos, and personal data. Many existing vault apps suffer from confusing interfaces, weak encryption, or intrusive ads. This project strives to build a clean, intuitive, and privacy-centric vault application that makes storing and retrieving private content both safe and simple.",
    points: [
      "Ensuring strong encryption and secure storage for photos and sensitive files",
      "Implementing biometric and password-based authentication layers",
      "Designing a seamless user experience with minimal UI friction",
      "Balancing privacy with utility features like photo view, file manager, and quick access",
      "Delivering a responsive app that feels fluid even on low-end devices"
    ]
  },

  // Solution
  solution: {
    overview:
      "The Vault Privacy Utility app provides a secure environment for users to protect sensitive files and photos behind encrypted storage combined with biometric or password protection. Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, the app balances a sleek UX with enterprise-ready security foundations, making privacy accessible to everyday users.",
